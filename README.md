<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

:white_check_mark: This docker image is based on work from [@lucaslorentz](https://github.com/lucaslorentz/caddy-docker-proxy) which I included the [plugin Cloudflare](https://github.com/caddy-dns/cloudflare). 

:o: This is only difference between this one and his image. 

:notebook_with_decorative_cover: If you need more details about how to use this image I will advise you to go to his GitHub and review the [documentation](https://github.com/lucaslorentz/caddy-docker-proxy).

:biohazard: It is useful if you are planning to use the reverse proxy from :tm: [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) together with [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) and [Cloudflare DNS](https://www.cloudflare.com/dns/) as a challenge. 

:star_of_david: The main purpose of creating this image is to have DNS challenge for **wildcard domains**. 

:trident: I am using GitHub Actions where it will update weekly docker image and both plugins.

:interrobang: Note: you will need **the scoped API token** for this setup. Please analyze this **[link](https://github.com/libdns/cloudflare#authenticating)**.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

:beginner: It will work on any Linux box amd64 or [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org) with arm64 or arm32. 

### Prerequisites

:eight_spoked_asterisk: You will need to have:

* :whale: [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
* :whale2: [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) 

:arrow_up: [Go on TOP](#about-the-project) :point_up:

<!-- USAGE -->
## Usage

:beginner: It will work on any Linux box amd64 or [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org) with arm64 or arm32. 

### Docker Compose

:warning: You will have to use **labels** in docker-compose deployment. Please review below what it means each [label](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/directives/tls). :arrow_down:

:radioactive: You will tell :tm: [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) where it has to route traffic in docker network, as :tm: [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) is **ingress** on this case. 

:arrow_down: A simple [docker-compose.yml](https://docs.docker.com/compose/):


```
version: "3.3"

services:
  caddy:
    container_name: caddy
    image: homeall/caddy-reverse-proxy-cloudflare:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock" #### needs socket to read events
      - "./caddy-data:/data" #### needs volume to back up certificates
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    labels: # Global options
      caddy.email: email@example.com #### needs for acme CERT registration account

  whoami0:
    container_name: whoiam
    image: jwilder/whoami:latest
    hostname: YourBigBoss ############################----->>Expected result using curl
    restart: unless-stopped
    labels:
      caddy: your.example.com #### needs for caddy to redirect traffic
      caddy.reverse_proxy: "{{upstreams 8000}}" #### needs to tell caddy which port number should send traffic
      caddy.tls.protocols: "tls1.3" #### This is optional. Default it is tls1.2
      caddy.tls.ca: "https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory" # Needs only for testing purpose. Remove this line after you finished your tests.
      caddy.tls.dns: "cloudflare $API-TOKEN" #### You will have to replace here $API-TOKEN with your real scoped API token from Cloudflare.
```
### Testing

:8ball: You can run command:
 
`$ curl -kivL -H 'Host: your.example.com' 'https://localhost'`

:arrow_down: Output results:

:hearts: On the status column of the docker, you will notice the `healthy` word. This is telling you that docker is running [healtcheck](https://scoutapm.com/blog/how-to-use-docker-healthcheck) itself in order to make sure it is working properly. 

:arrow_down: Please test yourself using the following command:

```
‚ùØ docker inspect --format "{{json .State.Health }}" caddy | jq
{
  "Status": "healthy",
  "FailingStreak": 0,
  "Log": [
    {
      "Start": "2021-01-04T11:10:49.2975799Z",
      "End": "2021-01-04T11:10:49.3836437Z",
      "ExitCode": 0,
      "Output": ""
    }
  ]
}
